The MCO Phase 1 begins at the index.html web page.

The group chose to make a forum web application. We decided to make in a food open forum for sharing recipes, discussing food adventures, experiences, and to create an overall community for those who are great at and love cooking. The name of the forum is "Pots and Posts"

// TODO: change readme for MCO2

The MCO phase 1 allows you to use the account of "SweetTreatsMama" in order to see the "Logged-in" view of the forum
If the user opts to continue to the forum without logging in, they will always have the option to log into the account from the upper left corner.
If the user opts to log-out of the acocunt, they can do so by clicking on the account name (either on a post or from the upper left) and then clicking "Log out" in the right sidebar
